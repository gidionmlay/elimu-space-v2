# ⚡ Quick Fix Reference - Course Upload Issues

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### 1. Setup Cloudinary (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Sign up at https://cloudinary.com (free)
# Get credentials from Dashboard
# Add to backend/.env:
```
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### 2. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# ✅ Look for: "Socket.IO: Ready"
```

### 3. Start Frontend
```bash
cd elimu-connect-learn-main
npm run dev
# ✅ Opens at http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Test Upload
1. Login as instructor
2. Go to Create Course
3. Upload thumbnail
4. **✅ Should see**: Progress bar → Success toast → No blinking!

### 5. Test Approval
1. Click "Publish Course"
2. **✅ Expected**: "Course submitted for review" toast
3. Check DB: `status: 'pending'`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ❌ 404 `/instructor/thumbnail` | ✅ Created upload endpoints |

## 📋 New Endpoints

```http
POST /api/v1/instructor/thumbnail  # Upload thumbnail
POST /api/v1/upload/video          # Upload video
POST /api/v1/upload/resource       # Upload files
POST /api/v1/courses/create        # Create draft
POST /api/v1/courses/:id/submit    # Submit for review
GET  /api/v1/admin/courses/pending # Admin queue
PUT  /api/v1/admin/courses/:id/approve
PUT  /api/v1/admin/courses/:id/reject
```

## ✅ Files Created

**Backend (5 files)**:
- `src/middlewares/multer.ts`
- `src/services/cloudinaryService.ts`
- `src/controllers/uploadController.ts`
- `src/routes/uploadRoutes.ts`
- `src/routes/adminRoutes.ts`

**Frontend (Modified 3 files)**:
- `services/courseService.ts` - Fixed upload functions
- `components/course-creation/BasicInfoStep.tsx` - Progress handling
- `pages/CreateCourse.tsx` - State management

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Upload fails?
- ✅ Check Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- ✅ Verify backend is running
- ✅ Check auth token is valid

### Button still blinks?
- ✅ Clear browser cache
- ✅ Restart frontend dev server
- ✅ Check no `setInterval` in code

### Not going to pending?
- ✅ Verify Course model updated
- ✅ Check MongoDB for `status` field
- ✅ Restart backend after model changes
