# Hero Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for the Hero Section component.

## Files

- `hero-placeholder.png` - Placeholder image for the main hero illustration
  - **Description**: Student with laptop (as shown in the reference design)
  - **Dimensions**: Recommended 400x500px or similar aspect ratio
  - **Format**: PNG with transparency support
  - **Usage**: Replace this placeholder with the actual hero image

## Implementation Notes

The HeroSection component includes fallback styling when the image is not found, displaying a gradient placeholder with appropriate styling that matches the design system.

## Design Reference

The hero image should match the reference design showing:
- A young woman with dark, wavy hair
- Wearing a white collared shirt
- Smiling broadly with an open-mouthed, joyful expression
- Looking upwards and to the right
- Holding an open silver laptop in her left hand
- Conveying enthusiasm and engagement
