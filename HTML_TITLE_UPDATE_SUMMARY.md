```

**This is intentional** as per your instruction to keep SEO metadata unchanged. If you want consistency across all metadata, we can update the Open Graph title separately.

- Monitor search engine indexing for the new title
- Update any documentation that references the old title
- Check if there are any hardcoded references in marketing materials
